    "- renames question columns for easier reference\n",
    "- converting wait times to numerical values, taking the median/mean of the range\n",
    "- adding synthetic event column: USS only has 1 notable special event which is HHN, which is assigned to visitors that came during October - December season. Otherwise, the column is assigned as none. For visitors that forgot the timeline in which they visited, a random value will be assigned.\n",
    "- handling long wait times: splits attractions that have long wait times into separate observations and assign a baseline wait time which is 90 minutes, for those that felt queueing time was not worth the experience, and 75 for those that do. \n",
    "- normalise guest satisfaction score\n",
    "- process timestamp and extracting date features\n",
    "- filters for valid attractions, which only keeps popular attractions like: revenge of the mummy, cylon, transformers, etc\"\n",
