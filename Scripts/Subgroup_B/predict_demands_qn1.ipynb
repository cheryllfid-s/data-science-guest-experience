    "Purpose:\n",
    "Loads and processes a survey dataset to prepare it for further analysis or modeling. The function handles renaming columns, standardizing attraction names, mapping wait time categories, normalizing satisfaction scores, and creating synthetic data for long wait attractions. It also infers the visitor's season of visit and assigns synthetic events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments:\n",
    "file_path (str): Path to the CSV file containing the survey data (default: \"../../data/survey.csv\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns:\n",
    "pd.DataFrame: A cleaned and processed DataFrame ready for further analysis or modeling. The resulting DataFrame includes columns like Favorite_Attraction, Avg_Wait_Time, Satisfaction_Score, Age_Group, Employment_Status, Visit_Quarter, and others, with appropriate transformations applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Overview:\n",
    "1. Rename Columns: Renames survey columns to standardized and more intuitive names for easier analysis.\n",
    "2. Map Attractions to Standardized Names: The function maps the names of attractions mentioned in the dataset to a consistent naming scheme using a predefined dictionary.\n",
    "3. Map Wait Time Categories: Converts textual wait time categories (e.g., \"Less than 15 minutes\") to numeric values representing the average wait times.\n",
    "4. Normalize Satisfaction Scores: Normalizes the satisfaction score column to a range between 0 and 1 for easier comparison and modeling.\n",
    "5. Infer Season of Visit: Maps the textual representation of the visitor's season of visit to quarterly time buckets (e.g., \"Jan-Mar\", \"Apr-Jun\").\n",
    "6. Assign Synthetic Event Data: Adds a synthetic Event column, randomly assigning either \"None\" or \"Special Event\" with predefined probabilities (80% \"None\", 20% \"Special Event\").\n",
    "7. Explode Long Wait Attractions: For visitors who mentioned having experienced long wait times, this step creates new rows for each attraction they encountered, assigning random wait times between 75-105 minutes.\n",
    "8. Select and Return Final Columns: The function then selects the most relevant columns for analysis and combines the original dataset with the newly created data for long wait attractions."
