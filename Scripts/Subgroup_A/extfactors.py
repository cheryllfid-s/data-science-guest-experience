# Guests across all segments exhibited lower sentiment when keywords related to rain were mentioned in their reviews. This suggests that unfavorable weather conditions negatively impact the overall guest experience. Additionally, Segment 1 "Value-Conscious Families" and Segment 2 "Budget-Conscious Youths" showed the strongest decline in sentiment, indicating that weather disruptions may disproportionately affect guests who are more price-sensitive in their visits. The decline in sentiment could be attributed to fewer outdoor activities or discomfort caused by wet conditions.
# 
# Value-conscious families with children are the most affected by rain likely due to:
# 1. The disruption to outdoor attractions and play areas that children enjoy.
# 2. Comfort and convenience concerns for both children and parents.
# 3. Limited access to family-friendly amenities and attractions in the rain.
# 4. The higher expectations of value for money and potential dissatisfaction when the park experience doesnâ€™t meet those expectations.
# 
# This may be due to the rain disrupting outdoor play areas and attractions, making them less enjoyable or inaccessible. For families with children, the rain might limit the park experience, especially when children are not able to engage in outdoor activities they find exciting. Parents might be more cautious about outdoor rides, especially if they are wet or slippery. Parents of young children might decide to avoid certain activities if the weather poses any safety risks, even if there are indoor alternatives.
# 
# Furthermore, parents with young children often bring strollers and in rainy conditions, strollers become harder to maneuver or may get wet, creating additional inconvenience. The need for rain gear for the entire family (umbrellas, ponchos) can add to the stress, especially if the park does not provide adequate shelter or rain protection. Moreover, for these value-conscious families, they might feel the cost of poncho for each family too much to spend on top of the admission tickets.
# 
# As "value-conscious" guests, these families likely expect a lot of value for their money. Rain can lead to less value because outdoor attractions they were excited about might be inaccessible or less enjoyable, leading to dissatisfaction with the cost of the experience.

# The trend of guest count across Budget-Conscious Youths,Premium Spenders, and Social-Driven Youths segments during the different periods remained fairly consistent. For Value-Conscious Families segment, the volume of guests in February to April and August to September periods were lower when compared to the higher volume seen in the summer (May to July) and winter (November to January) periods. 
# 
# This pattern is likely influenced by several factors, including seasonal availability, as families, particularly those with children, tend to visit more during school holidays in the summer and winter. Furthermore, the winter holiday period (November to January) aligns with family vacations and year-end celebrations, contributing to higher guest volume. 
# 
# While there are some fluctuations in the exact number of visitors across segments, the overall trend shows a clear drop in guest count in the low-season months (February to April and August to September). This reinforces the idea that external factors such as timing, weather, and events play a crucial role in driving guest attendance and satisfaction.
# 
# Overall, these trends suggest that Universal Studios experiences a cyclical pattern of higher and lower guest volumes for Value-Conscious Families segment based on the calendar year and external conditions, which could influence decisions related to staffing, promotions, and overall resource management.

# %% [markdown]
# Operational adjustments:
# 1. Organize special events, festivals, or limited-time shows during off-peak periods to maintain high guest engagement. For example, consider hosting smaller-scale events, exclusive promotions, or theme nights tailored to specific segments.
# 2. During months with lower guest volume, reduce staffing levels to maintain cost-efficiency. Conversely, during periods with peak attendance, ensure enough staff are available to handle the increased guest flow.
# 3. For segments like Premium Spenders and Value-Conscious Families, offer loyalty programs or re-engagement incentives (e.g., discounts or priority access) to encourage repeat visits during quieter months.
# 4. Send targeted emails with special offers or event notifications to guests who visited during peak times but might not typically visit during off-peak periods. These incentives could include discounts or exclusive offers to lure them back during quieter months.
